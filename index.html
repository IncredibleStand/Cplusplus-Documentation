				<h3>What is C++?</h3>
			  <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.</p>
			  <p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.</p>
			  <p>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>
			  <p>The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23.</p>
			  <p>The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.</p>

		  <header>Why Learn C++?</header>
		  <h3>Reasons</h3>
		  	<article>
		  		<p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</p>
		  		<p>C++ is fun and easy to learn!</p>
		  		<p>C++ is used to create computer programs, and is one of the most used language in game development.</p>
		  		<p><strong>Advice:</strong> C++ is an object oriented language and some concepts may be new. Take breaks when needed, and go over the examples as many times as needed.</p>
		   	</article>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="Hello_World!">
			<header>Hello World!</header>
			<article>
			  <p>To get started with writing C++, open Sublime Text or an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) of your choice and write your first "Hello World!" C++ code:</p>
			  <code>
			    #include <iostream>
			  		
				int main() 
				{
				  std::cout << "Hello World!";
				  return 0;
				}
			  </code>
			  <ul>
			  	<li><strong>#include <iostream></strong> - This is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects. Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
                </li>
                <li><strong>int main()</strong> - This is called a <i>Function</i>. Any code inside its curly brackets will be executed.</li>
                <li><strong>std::</strong> - The std is a short form of <i>standard</i>, the std namespace contains the built-in classes and declared functions. </li>
                <li><strong>cout</strong> - This is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World!".</li>
                <li><strong>return 0</strong> - This ends the main function.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <h4>Result:</h4>
			  <code>	
			  	Hello World!
			  </code>
			  <p>Congratulations! You have now written and executed your first C++ program.</p>
			</article>

			<section class="main-section" id="Variables">
				<header>Variables</header>
				<h3>C++ Variables</h3>
				<article>
				  <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
				  <p>In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:</p>
				  <ul>
				  	<li><strong>int</strong> - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
					<li><strong>double</strong> - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
					<li><strong>char</strong> - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
					<li><strong>string</strong> - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
					<li><strong>bool</strong> - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
				  </ul>
				  <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
				  <p>To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:
				  <h4>Syntax:</h4>
				  <code>type vaiableName = value;</code>
				  <p>To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:</p>
				  <h4>Example</h4>
				  <p>Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:</p>
				  <code>
				  	int myNum = 15;
					cout << myNum;
				  </code>
				  <p>You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:</p>		  
				  <code>
				  	int myNum;
					myNum = 15;
					cout << myNum;
				  </code>
				  <p><b>Note</b> that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:</p>

			<section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
			  <header>Data Types</header>
			  <article>
			  	<h3>Basic Data Types</h3>
			  	<p>The data type specifies the size and type of information the variable will store:</p>
			  	<table>
			  		<tr>
			  		  <th>Data Type</th>
			  		  <th>Size</th>
			  		  <th>Description</th>
			  		</tr>
			  		<tr>
			  		  <td>boolean</td>
			  		  <td>1 byte</td>
			  		  <td>Stores true or false values</td>
			  		</tr>
			  		<tr>
			  		  <td>char</td>
			  		  <td>1 byte</td>
			  		  <td>Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values</td>
			  		</tr>
			  		<tr>
			  		  <td>int</td>
			  		  <td>2 or 4 bytes</td>
			  		  <td>Stores whole numbers, without decimals</td>
			  		</tr>
			  		<tr>
			  		  <td>float</td>
			  		  <td>4 bytes</td>
			  		  <td>Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6-7 decimal digits</td>
			  		</tr>
			  		<tr>
			  		  <td>double</td>
			  		  <td>8 bytes</td>
			  		  <td>Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits</td>
			  		</tr>

			  		<header>Operators</header>
			  		<h3>C++ Operators</h3>
			  		<article>
			  	      <p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.</p>
			  	      <p>In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:</p>
			  	      <h4>Example</h4>
			  	      <code>int x = 100 + 50;</code>
			  	      <p>C++ divides the operators into the following groups:</p>
			  	      <ul>
			  	      	<li>Arithmetic operators</li>
			  	      	<li>Assignment operators</li>
			  	      	<li>Comparison operators</li>
			  	      	<li>Logical operators</li>
			  	      	<li>Bitwise operators</li>
			  	      </ul>
			  		</article>

			  		<section class="main-section" id="Conditions">
			  			<header>Conditions</header>
			  			<h4>C++ Conditions and If Statements</h4>
			  			<p>You already know that C++ supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
			  			<ul>
			  			  <li>Less than: a < b</li>
						  <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
					      <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
						  <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
						  <li>Equal to a == b</li>
						  <li>Not Equal to: a != b</li>
			  			</ul>	
			  			<p>You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.</p>
			  			<p>C++ has the following conditional statements:</p>
			  			<ul>
			  			  <li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.</li>
						  <li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.</li>
						  <li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.</li>
						  <li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
			  			</ul>
			  			<h4>The if Statement</h4>
			  			<p>Use the if statement to specify a block of C++ code to be executed if a condition is true.</p>
			  			<h4>Example</h4>
			  			<code>
			  			  int x = 20;
						  int y = 18;
						  if (x > y) 
						  {
						  cout << "x is greater than y";
						  }
			  			</code>
			  			<h5>Example explained</h5>
						<p>In the example above we use two variables, x and y, to test whether x is greater than y (using the > operator). As x is 20, and y is 18, and we know that 20 is greater than 18, we print to the screen that "x is greater than y".</p>
						<h4>The else Statement</h4>
						<p>Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.</p>
						<h4>Example</h4>
						<code>int time = 20;
							  if (time < 18) {
							  cout << "Good day.";
							  } else {
  							  cout << "Good evening.";
							  }
							  // Outputs "Good evening."
						</code>
						<h5>Example explained</h5>
						<p>In the example above, time (20) is greater than 18, so the condition is false. Because of this, we move on to the else condition and print to the screen "Good evening". If the time was less than 18, the program would print "Good day".</p>
						<h4>The else if Statement</h4>
						<p>Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.</p>
						<h4>Example</h4>
						<code>
							int time = 22;
							if (time < 10) {
							  cout << "Good morning.";
							} else if (time < 20) {
							  cout << "Good day.";
							} else {
							  cout << "Good evening.";
							}
							// Outputs "Good evening."
						</code>
						<h5>Example explained</h5>
						<p>In the example above, time (22) is greater than 10, so the first condition is false. The next condition, in the else if statement, is also false, so we move on to the else condition since condition1 and condition2 is both false - and print to the screen "Good evening".</p>
						<p>However, if the time was 14, our program would print "Good day."</p>

			  		<section class="main-section" id="Switch">
			  			<header>Switch</header>
			  			<article>
			  				<h3>C++ Switch Statements</h3>
			  			   <p>Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.</p>
			  			   <p>This is how it works:</p>
			  			   <ul>
			  			     <li>The switch expression is evaluated once
							 The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case</li>
							 <li>If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed</li>
							 <li>The break and default keywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter</li>
							</ul>
							 <p>The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:</p>
							 <h4>Example</h4>
							 <code>
							 	int day = 4;
								switch (day) 
								{
								  case 1:
								    cout << "Monday";
								    break;
								  case 2:
								    cout << "Tuesday";
								    break;
								  case 3:
								    cout << "Wednesday";
								    break;
								  case 4:
								    cout << "Thursday";
								    break;
								  case 5:
								    cout << "Friday";
								    break;
								  case 6:
								    cout << "Saturday";
								    break;
								  case 7:
								    cout << "Sunday";
								    break;
								}
							 </code>
			  			  	 <h3>The break Keyword</h3>
			  			  	 <p>When C++ reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.</p>
			  			  	 <p>This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.</p>
			  			  	 <p>When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.</p>
			  			  	 <h3>The default Keyword</h3>
			  			  	 <p>The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match.</p>

			  			<article>
			  				<h4>C++ Arrays</h4>
			  				<p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.</p>
			  				<p>To declare an array, define the variable type, specify the name of the array followed by square brackets and specify the number of elements it should store:</p>
			  				<code>string cars[4];</code>
			  				<p>We have now declared a variable that holds an array of four strings. To insert values to it, we can use an array literal - place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:</p>
			  				<code>string cars[4] = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};</code>
			  				<h4>Access the Elements of an Array</h4>
			  				<p>You access an array element by referring to the index number inside square brackets [].</p>
			  				<p>This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:</p>
			  				<h5>Example</h5>
			  				<code>
			  				  string cars[4] = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
							  cout << cars[0];
							  // Outputs Volvo
			  				</code>

			  		  <article>
			  		  	<h3>C++ Functions</h3>
			  		  	  <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.</p>

						  <p>You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.</p>

						  <p>Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</p>
						  <h4>Create a Function</h4>
						  <p>C++ provides some pre-defined functions, such as main(), which is used to execute code. But you can also create your own functions to perform certain actions.</p>
						  <p>To create (often referred to as declare) a function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses ():</p>
						  <h4>Syntax</h4>
						  <code>
						  	void myFunction() 
						  	{
 							 // code to be executed
							}
						  </code>
						  <h5>Example Explained</h5>
						  	<ul>
						  	  <li>myFunction() is the name of the function</li>
							  <li>void means that the function does not have a return value.</li> 
							  <li>You will learn more about return values later in the next chapter
							  inside the function (the body), add code that defines what the function should do</li>
						  	</ul>
						  	<h4>Call a Function</h4>
						  	<p>Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are called.</p>
						  	<p>To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ;</p>
						  	<p>In the following example, myFunction() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:</p>
						  	<h5>Example</h5>
						  	<p>Inside main, call myFunction():</p>
						  	<code>
						  	  // Create a function
							  void myFunction() 
							  {
							  std::cout << "I just got executed!";
							  }

							  int main() 
							  {
								myFunction(); // call the function
								return 0;
							  }

							  // Outputs "I just got executed!"
						  	</code>

			  			<article>
			  				<h3>C++ What is OOP?</h3>
			  				<p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
			  				<p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.</p>
			  				<p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>
			  				<ul>
			  				  <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute
							  OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.</li>
							  <li>OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.</li>
							  <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
			  				</ul>
			  				<p><strong>Advice:</strong> The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.</p>
			  				<h4>C++ What are Classes and Objects?</h4>
			  				<p>Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.</p>
			  				<p>Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.</p>
			  				<p>Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".</p>
			  				<p>A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</p>
			  				<h4>Create a Class</h4>
			  				<p>To create a class, use the class keyword:</p>
			  				<h3>Example</h3>
			  				<p>Create a class called "MyClass":</p>
			  				<code>
			  				  class MyClass 		  // The class
			  				  {       
									public:           // Access specifier
								    int myNum;        // Attribute (int variable)
								    string myString;  // Attribute (string variable)
							  };
			  				</code>
			  				<h5>Example Explained</h5>
			  				<ul>
			  				  <li>The class keyword is used to create a class called MyClass.</li>
							  <li>The public keyword is an access specifier, which specifies that members (attributes and methods) of the class are accessible from outside the class.</li>
							  <li>Inside the class, there is an integer variable myNum and a string variable myString. When variables are declared within a class, they are called attributes.</li>
							  <li>At last, end the class definition with a semicolon ;.</li>
			  				</ul>
			  				<h4>Create an Object</h4>
			  				<p>In C++, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named MyClass, so now we can use this to create objects.</p>
			  				<p>To create an object of MyClass, specify the class name, followed by the object name.</p>
			  				<p>To access the class attributes (myNum and myString), use the dot syntax (.) on the object:</p>
			  				<h5>Example</h5>
			  				<p>Create an object called "myObj" and access the attributes:</p>
			  				<code>
			  				  	class MyClass         // The class
			  				  	{       
								  public:             // Access specifier
								    int myNum;        // Attribute (int variable)
								    string myString;  // Attribute (string variable)
								};

								int main() 
								{
								  MyClass myObj;  // Create an object of MyClass

								  // Access attributes and set values
								  myObj.myNum = 15; 
								  myObj.myString = "Some text";

								  // Print attribute values
								  std::cout << myObj.myNum << "\n";
								  std::cout << myObj.myString;
								  return 0;
								}
